Additional input icons, from Wonderswan button layouts, dance mats and steering wheels/pedals, to Rock Band peripherals, Pop 'n' Music and the Stadia button.

Ostensibly for use with Retroarch's Monochrome theme, although they are speculative / hobby work so there's no code to back it up.

All icons as of 2024-05-29:
